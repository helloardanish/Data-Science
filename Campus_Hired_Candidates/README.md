# Hiring Students From Campus

#### In this project I'll be checking whether a student will be hired or not and what are important factors for being hired and getting a good salary.

## What is in the data ?

This data set consists of Placement data of students in any campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and Work experience and salary offers to the placed students

### Questions I'll be covering in this project:
* Which factor influenced a candidate in getting placed?
* Does percentage matters for one to get placed?
* Which degree specialization is much demanded by corporate?
* Play with the data conducting all statistical tests.

### *Hope you'll like it, all suggestions are always welcome!*
