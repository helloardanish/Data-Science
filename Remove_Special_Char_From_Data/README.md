# Remove special characters from your data

### A git repo to remove a set of special character from your data and clean messy data.

## I have used a dummy data for testing purpose state city might differ in real world data.

### What I had was a data where each cell had messy data with special characters like this

| Name        |    City     |   State       |     Phone    |
| -----------    |    -----------   |   -----------  |     -----------  |
| A R D%$@#anish | Da\*r$-b&ha@nga | Bih%$ar   | 1234$%567890   |   
| A R Ra$@#shid   | Mad*$h-ub&a@ni        | $@Bih%$ar      | 424%4$%567891 |
|Sonu Kh%$@an |	Pat*$t&na@	| %Bih%$ar	| 5#@434$%567892 |
|Qama$r%@# J	| G\*a-&y$a@	| %Bih$ar	| 1&\*234$%567893 |
| Ka$#vya%$	 | Gha\*z$ia-b&@ad |	#@\*Bih%$ar |	123*&4$%56#7894 |


### After removing all the special characters. This is the clean data.

| Name |	City | 	State |	Phone |
| -----    | -----  | -----  |  -----  |
| A R Danish	| Darbhanga |	Bihar |	1234567890 |
| A R Rashid |	Madhubani |	Bihar |	4244567891 |
| Sonu Khan |	Pattna |	Bihar |	5434567892 |
| Qamar J |	Gaya |	Bihar |	1234567893 |
| Kavya |	Ghaziabad |	Bihar |	1234567894 |
